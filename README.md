This is the repository for our Software Development class.
The task was to create our first, simple web-application.

### How to run:
 1. Clone it
 2. In the main folder start terminal (or PowerShell) and type `docker-compose up`
 3. Start IntelliJ and run class App.
 4. Now just run `http://localhost:63342/ProjektPracProg/front/index.html` and enjoy.
 5. When you want to finish, Ctrl-C the terminal. You might also want to type `docker-compose down`.

#### Few things:

 - Docker was not necessary, it was my own idea to try it here. It was also my first time with docker.
 - I used IntelliJ Ultimate which has built-in Tomcat - if you don't have that version you might want to download and run Tomcat manually.
 - I'm a very minimalistic front-end designer ;)
